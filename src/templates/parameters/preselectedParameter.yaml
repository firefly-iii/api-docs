  description: |
    Optional set of preselected accounts to limit the chart to. This may be easier than submitting all asset accounts manually, for example.
    If you want to know which selection are available, see the enums here or get the configuration value: `GET /api/v1/configuration/firefly.preselected_accounts`
    
    - `empty`: do not do a pre-selection
    - `all`: select all asset and all liability accounts
    - `assets`: select all asset accounts
    - `liabilities`: select all liability accounts
    
    If no accounts are found, the user's "frontpage accounts" preference will be used. If that is empty, all asset accounts will be used.
