# Firefly III API documentation

The Firefly III API documentation can be found on [api-docs.firefly-iii.org](https://api-docs.firefly-iii.org). This repository holds the static website (in the `/dist` directory) and the source files (in the `/src` directory).

The source files are split up in paths that correspond to the API endpoints (under `/src/v1`). General templates and other items are in the `templates` and `shared` directory. The API specification is generated by stitching together these files using a build script, the [API docs generator](https://github.com/firefly-iii/api-docs-generator).

The results are uploaded to this repository and can be viewed live at [api-docs.firefly-iii.org](https://api-docs.firefly-iii.org/).

## Contributing

Feel free to create a PR on anything. If you want to change endpoints, check out `src/v1/paths`. Or edit objects in `/src/v1/schemas`. This is my first API document so feel free to tell me how to improve. Make your changes and submit a pull request.

## Branches

This repository is branched for each Firefly III version. The `main` branch holds the latest develop version.

## Templates

You can see lines in the YAML files that look like this:

```yaml
_tpl_correlationParameter,3:
```

These are placeholders which will change during build. You see the name of the template (see `/src/templates/`), and the number tabs to indent the template.

## Using the API specification

If you want, you can download the yaml file you need from the `dist` directory and import it into your favorite API development environment to play around with, e.g. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).
